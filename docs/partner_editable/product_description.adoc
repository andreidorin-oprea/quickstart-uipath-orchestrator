With UiPath Orchestrator, you can securely schedule, manage, and control your entire enterprise-wide digital workforce of UiPath software robots. Orchestrator manages the creation, monitoring, and deployment of RPA resources in your environment, acting as an integration point with third-party solutions and applications.

UiPath Orchestrator can manage your entire fleet, including the following UiPath Robot types: 

* *Attended* - A robot triggered by user events, operating alongside a human user, and sharing the same workstation. Used with UiPath Orchestrator for centralized process deployment and logging. They can also add data into a queue that is processed by unattended UiPath Robots.
* *Unattended* - A robot that runs without human supervision in a virtual environment. They run, monitor, schedule, and support work queues remotely.
* *Development* - An unattended robot used only for development purposes.
* *Nonproduction* - An unattended robot used only for development and testing purposes.

// With this Quick Start, you can deploy UiPath Orchestrator in an architecture based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. There are two deployment options: single-node or multi-node with the High Availability add-on (HAA) for UiPath Orchestrator. The single-node option runs the UiPath Orchestrator web server on a single machine and is recommended for small to medium scale deployment of UiPath Robot. The multi-node option with HAA is designed for increased capacity and failure resistance. For more information, see link:#_architecture[Architecture], later in this guide.
